# SDAU-Spring-2018
Introductory R workshop: The tidyverse and beyond

The lecture notes and R scripts given below are from an introductory R workshop hosted by the HRB CRF-C in the Spring of 2018. The lecture notes are punctuated with prompts to jump into the R scripts as you go and to see what we're talking about. All the scripts are composed in such a way, so that you can run each line yourself and get the outputs you expect. At certain points, there are exercises for you to complete yourself, which hopefully will allow you to get a feel for writing your own code. 

Workshop 1:
First time users are given a crash course in this session, broadly along the lines of that described by David Robinson here (http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/). We proceed to take it on from there. The lecture notes discuss the need for learning R, especially if you are engaging in research in the life sciences. We follow this up with an overview of R, R packages and the basic steps of data analysis. 

The structure of the tidyverse code is outlined and the fundamental ideas of tidy data are described. You won't learn how to use R in this session, but hopefully you will get a sense of how it can do powerful things with very little effort. 

Workshop 2:
We go through the, must know, basics of the R language including data types, indexing and having a go at importing data into RStudio. 

Workshop 3: 
Ok, before we go any further, now is a good time to look at finding help for when things go wrong. This session begins with identifying the problems that crop up when you write some code. RStudio will help you out a bit, but you need to be able to understand what you're being told. Once you begin to understand the error messages, you can start exploring R properly, notably by using the inbuilt help, access to cheatsheet for popular packages and reaching out to the web for assistance.  

Workshop 4:
Ok, you've gotten your feet wet with R. Now the time has come to dive into the tidyverse. Here we explore the main data wrangling packages of tidyr and dplyr. We follow the examples given by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund in their book "R for Data Science".  

Workshop 5:
Data visualisation is an important part of any project. In the tidyverse, ggplot2 is a powerful package to help with this. The session takes you through the 'grammar of graphics' and ends with a more stepwise version of an excellent tutorial to be found at http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html  

Workshop 6:
Here we look to bring everything together. Part of this session is to encourage you to make your research projects more reproducible and to move away from copy/paste actions towards automatic report generation. We give pointers on how you can help your future-self on your research journey. This session finished up with directions to other resources that you may look to, as you integrate R more and more into your daily work.

Enjoy!
