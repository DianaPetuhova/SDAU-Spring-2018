Introductory R workshop: The tidyverse and beyond

The lecture notes and R scripts given below are from a introductory R workshop hosted by the HRB CRF-C in the Spring of 2018. 

First time users are given a crash course in the tidyverse during the e first workshop, along the lines of that described by David Robinson here (http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/). We proceed to take it on from there.

Enjoy?
