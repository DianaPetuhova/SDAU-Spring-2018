#                     1: Navigating R packages
####################################################################
# The power of R is derived from the packages that can be loaded and run

# The steps below will help you load a package and navigate through 
# some of the package contents

# You need to load packages for each new session
# 1. Type library(tidyverse) into the console below

# "library" is a function that will load and attach packages

# Note any messages that get displayed when the tidyverse is loaded

# 2. Type "dplyr::" and scroll through the list of functions/data

# 3. Access additional information by typing "?" followed by the function
# e.g. "?dplyr::select"

# You can also get more information on the sample data sets by using "?"
# 4. Type "?mpg" into the console

# R is case sensitive
# 5. Type "r <- 5"
# Type "r" and hit return

# Type "R" and hit return
